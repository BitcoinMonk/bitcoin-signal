This is how we win.

Don't like mining centralization or core devs telling you what you can or can't do with your node?

Then turn up the difficulty adjustment on the centralized pools make your own block templates using DATUM.

This thing uses as much electricity as a light bulb. If everyone turned on a light, mining would be decentralized tomorrow.

Knots, Ocean, Datum That's what it means to run bitcoin, literally and metaphorically.

//new post if your bitcoin isn't making more bitcoin for you thats only because you're doing it wrong.

Run knots and mine with @ocean_mining , or solo, using DATUM. If we all do that we will put these mining pools out of bussiness.

Mining centralization solved. Your welcome. Easy.

Congrats on a great day today, @GrassFedBitcoin , @boomer_btc , Jason(i think), @LukeDashjr , @leo_haf , anyone else who I missed that is working on this project. Was it a record breaking day for you?

21 blocks in the window!!! Thank you for saving bitcoin from cores negligence.

Knots - All time high!!!

Ocean - All time high!?!

Bitcoin - All time high!!!!!

There is no such thing as coincedence!

Hey, how many transactions with op_returns > 80 bytes were there in all those blocks today? Were there any with more than one op_return? How many inscriptions were there? I'll find out if you dont know already.

Plebs, if you want to fix bitcoin then just mine with ocean and make your own block templates. That's it. The war is over. We just won. Congrats to all the knotzis out there, you faught vaiantly.

If you are not mining and producing your own block templates with datum you are why bitcoin might not succeed.

Get a bit axe and start mining! Every hash that a pleb adds makes the dificulty go up for EVERYBODY!!!!!!

How much are you willing to spend to protect your wealth. And you never know, you might get lucky. https://x.com/GrassFedBitcoin/status/1943909269365305826

The Key to Bitcoin’s Success: Decentralized Home Mining Bitcoin’s strength lies in its decentralization, a principle that ensures no single entity controls the network. Yet, mining centralization—where large pools dominate—threatens this core value. The recent surge in activity, highlighted by 21 blocks in a single window and all-time highs for Knots and Ocean, shows a path forward. Decentralizing mining is not just possible; it’s essential, and home mining with tools like DATUM and Ocean is the way to make it happen.Centralized mining pools and core developers imposing restrictions on nodes undermine Bitcoin’s ethos. If everyone can run their own node and mine with minimal energy—equivalent to a light bulb’s usage—the network could shift overnight. DATUM allows individuals to create their own block templates, bypassing pool dominance. By running Knots and mining with Ocean or solo, users can increase difficulty for centralized pools, forcing a more distributed hash rate. The recent Ocean hashrate chart, peaking in early July 2025, reflects this growing movement, with spikes signaling record-breaking participation.The data backs this up. On July 11, 2025, the network saw unprecedented activity, with contributors like @GrassFedBitcoin, @boomer_btc, and @LukeDashjr driving 21 blocks. This wasn’t coincidence—it was a deliberate push by “knotzis” to reclaim Bitcoin’s decentralized roots. Home mining doesn’t just protect wealth; it empowers users. Every hash a pleb adds raises the difficulty for all, leveling the playing field. If Bitcoin isn’t generating more Bitcoin for you, it’s because centralized mining has sidelined individual efforts. The solution? Get a “bit axe” and mine. This isn’t just technical—it’s philosophical. Bitcoin succeeds when its users control it. Centralized pools risk censorship or manipulation, while home mining ensures resilience. The recent highs—Knots, Ocean, and Bitcoin itself—prove the potential. Questions linger, like how many transactions with op_returns over 80 bytes or multiple op_returns occurred in those 21 blocks, or the number of inscriptions. These details matter, but the bigger picture is clear: decentralized mining is winning.The war isn’t over, but the tide is turning. Congrats to the pioneers who’ve fought valiantly. To protect Bitcoin’s future, every user must mine and produce their own block templates with DATUM. The cost is minimal—your electricity bill and a bit of effort. The reward? A decentralized network that thrives. Start today, and you might even get lucky with a block reward. Bitcoin’s success depends on us all turning on that light.

Ocean Mining’s Historic 21-Block Streak: A Win for Decentralized Bitcoin MiningComment: This section introduces Ocean Mining’s achievement, referencing the post’s excitement about “21 blocks in the window” and contextualizing it as a significant milestone for a decentralized mining pool.On July 11, 2025, Ocean Mining, a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool, achieved an extraordinary feat: mining 21 blocks in a single difficulty window, far exceeding the expected average of 8 blocks. Typically, Ocean finds a block every 14 hours, making this streak a remarkable outlier that underscores the pool’s growing influence. Backed by Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr and Jack Dorsey, Ocean’s success is attributed to its increasing hash rate, driven by an influx of miners drawn to its transparent, decentralized model. This milestone, celebrated across platforms like X, signals a shift in Bitcoin’s mining landscape, challenging the dominance of centralized pools and highlighting the potential of home mining.

Comment: This section addresses the post’s claim that home mining defies the “economically rational” argument of core developers, explaining why profitability isn’t the sole driver for miners.Core Bitcoin developers often argue that mining must be driven by economic rationality, prioritizing profitability through large-scale operations with access to cheap energy and high-powered hardware. However, Ocean’s model and the rise of home mining challenge this narrative. Devices like the Bitaxe, a compact, open-source Bitcoin miner, enable individuals to contribute hash power from home, even if the financial returns are modest. For many, the incentive isn’t purely profit but rather a commitment to Bitcoin’s ethos of decentralization. By mining at home, individuals help distribute hash power, reducing the risk of centralized control by large pools. The 2024 Bitcoin halving, which cut block rewards to 3.125 BTC, has intensified profitability pressures, yet Ocean’s decentralized approach, supported by tools like DATUM, empowers miners to prioritize network security over short-term gains.

Comment: This section expands on the post’s call to “make your own block templates” with DATUM, explaining how it empowers users and aligns with Ocean’s mission to decentralize mining.Ocean’s DATUM protocol is a game-changer, allowing miners to create their own block templates rather than relying on pool operators. This feature aligns with the post’s rallying cry: “Plebs, if you want to fix Bitcoin, then just mine with Ocean and make your own block templates.” By giving miners control over transaction selection, DATUM reduces the risk of censorship and ensures that Bitcoin’s blockchain remains a neutral, permissionless ledger. The post raises questions about transactions with large OP_RETURN outputs or inscriptions, reflecting concerns about spam or data-heavy transactions clogging the network. Ocean’s transparent model allows miners to prioritize transactions that align with their values, such as excluding excessive inscriptions, thereby reinforcing Bitcoin’s integrity. This hands-on approach empowers even small-scale miners to shape the network’s future.

Comment: This section ties together the post’s enthusiasm for decentralization and the broader implications of Ocean’s success, addressing the call to action for “knotzis” and the fight against mining centralization.Ocean’s 21-block streak is more than a lucky break; it’s a testament to the power of grassroots efforts in Bitcoin mining. The post’s triumphant tone—“The war is over. We just won.”—captures the sentiment that decentralized mining can counter the centralization threat posed by large pools. By running Bitcoin Knots (a Bitcoin Core fork with enhanced features) and mining with Ocean, individuals can contribute to a more resilient network. The post suggests that every hash added by home miners increases the difficulty for all, making centralization less viable. For many, the cost of a Bitaxe or similar hardware is a small price to pay to protect their wealth and Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Ocean’s milestone, paired with tools like DATUM, proves that home miners can make a difference, challenging the notion that only industrial-scale operations matter.

Comment: This conclusion reinforces the post’s optimism and call to action, encouraging readers to join the decentralized mining movement.Ocean Mining’s record-breaking day is a beacon for Bitcoin’s future, proving that decentralization isn’t just an ideal—it’s achievable. Whether you’re a “knotzi” running Bitcoin Knots or a pleb with a Bitaxe, every step toward decentralized mining strengthens Bitcoin. Join Ocean, craft your own block templates, and help secure the network. The fight for Bitcoin’s soul is far from over, but with Ocean’s 21-block triumph, the tide is turning.
