Welcome to The Bitcoin Signal, a blog dedicated to exploring the culture of Bitcoin and occasionally diving into its technical intricacies.

This blog was born out of the Op_Return War currently going on as a place to put my thoughts on the subject. I hope it can also be a place where people can learn something.

Our mission is to capture the pulse of the Bitcoin community, do our best to understand how it works and why it's important, and have a good time while were at it.

Whether you're a hardcore Bitcoiner or just curious about this marvel of engineering, we’re here to share stories, insights, and perspectives that highlight why Bitcoin is more than just code — it’s a revolution.

Stay tuned for more posts that celebrate the people and ideas shaping Bitcoin’s future!
