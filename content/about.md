**The Bitcoin Signal** is my culture node—a place where normal Bitcoiners can find out what's really going on in Bitcoin, without the noise.

This project was born during the Op_Return War as a place to put my thoughts on the subject. What started as a way to process the latest culture war in Bitcoin has evolved into something bigger: a publication dedicated to exploring Bitcoin's culture, occasionally diving into its technical intricacies, and most importantly, providing a platform for honest perspectives from real Bitcoiners.

## What We're About

Bitcoin's culture isn't decided by devs, VCs, or influencers—it's created by all of us. Every node runner, every pleb stacking sats, every person orange-pilling their barber contributes to what Bitcoin becomes. This publication exists to amplify those voices.

We believe Bitcoin is more than code—it's a revolution. It's a social layer built on proof of work, both in the code and in the culture. We're here to:

- **Cut through the noise** and deliver pure Bitcoin signal
- **Capture the pulse** of the Bitcoin community
- **Explore the culture wars** that shape Bitcoin's future
- **Understand how it works** and why it matters
- **Have a good time** while doing it

## For the Plebs, By the Plebs

Whether you're a hardcore Bitcoiner running Knots, a curious newcomer trying to understand why Bitcoin matters, or somewhere in between—this is for you. We're not here to tell you what Bitcoin should be. We're here to broadcast our signal and invite you to broadcast yours.

The Bitcoin Signal may evolve from a blog into a magazine, maybe even a printed publication someday. I'm still discovering what that looks like, but since you can't steer a parked car, I'll keep moving forward. Whatever form it takes, I can promise it will be honest perspectives on the current state of Bitcoin's culture, development, future, and impact on the world.

God willing, this becomes a place that normal Bitcoiners can count on to find out what's really happening in Bitcoin—where you can find pure Bitcoin Signal by the plebs and for the plebs.
